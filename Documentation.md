# NFT Mine Game Documentation

## Introduction

The NFT Mine Game is an interactive card-matching game designed to entertain players while introducing them to blockchain concepts. Players flip cards to find matching pairs, and upon completing the game, they are greeted with a popup message that also displays simulated blockchain transaction details using **Move** on the Aptos blockchain.

## Technologies Used

### Front-end Development
- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the game elements for a visually appealing experience.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game mechanics and interactions, including card flipping and matching.

### Blockchain Integration
- **Move**: Integrates blockchain functionalities into the game. After winning, **Move** simulates transaction details like transaction ID, success status, and Aptos amount earned, enhancing player engagement with educational content about blockchain technology.

### Deployment Platform
- **Netlify**: Hosts and deploys the NFT Mine Game online, ensuring accessibility for players worldwide.

## Game Features

1. **Card Matching**: Players click on cards to flip them and find matching pairs.
2. **Shuffling**: Cards are shuffled at the start of each game to ensure randomness.
3. **Win Popup**: Upon matching all pairs, a popup congratulates the player and displays blockchain-related transaction details using **Move**.
4. **Educational Value**: Through **Move**, players learn about blockchain transactions and their practical applications in gaming and beyond.

## Code Example: Integration of Move in game.js

```javascript
// Example code snippet demonstrating Move integration in game.js

// Function to display transaction details using Move after winning
function displayMoveDetails() {
    const moveDetails = document.createElement('div');
    moveDetails.classList.add('popup');
    const message = document.createElement('p');
    message.textContent = 'Congratulations! You won an NFT on the Aptos blockchain.';
    moveDetails.appendChild(message);

    // Simulated Move transaction details
    const transactionDetails = document.createElement('p');
    transactionDetails.textContent = `Transaction ID: ${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)} | Status: Success | Amount: 10 APT`;
    moveDetails.appendChild(transactionDetails);

    document.body.appendChild(moveDetails);

    // Remove transaction details after a delay
    setTimeout(() => {
        moveDetails.remove();
    }, 4000);
}
```
